The automated testing of software became more important for test managers in the last couple of years. The reasons are shorter release cycles and increasing cost pressure. Therefore, many test departments are facing the problem of automating their manual tests.

\SuperPar
One approach for this problem is keyword-driven testing, which became very popular in the last few years. Some open source tools and also some commercial solutions have been developed for this approach. However, this approach has many advantages but also some drawbacks: It becomes more and more difficult to maintain large projects. One reason for that is the limited tool support for this approach.

\SuperPar
This is the starting point for this master thesis. A new framework called Rayden, which covers the keyword-driven testing approach, is developed. The innovation of Rayden is, that the solution relies on a compiler to provide better tooling support for users. Another benefit of Rayden is an excellent integration of an object repository. All these advantages should help the user to develop better readable and maintainable tests.

\SuperPar
A Web application is tested to demonstrate the capabilities of Rayden. Some usages of different testing techniques are shown in the demonstration. This should help users to understand the benefits of Rayden.
